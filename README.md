# Overview
[JIPL](https://github.com/HoloInJava/jipl) is a **free**, **open-source** and **modular** programming language, designed for **simplicity** and **expansibility**. <br>
If your user has to write some code in your Java software, it can be a challenge to make it work properly, and that is *exactly* why we created this project. <br>
Being as beginner-friendly as possible with its easy syntax, JIPL offers a large toolkit of built-in functions while remaining as essential as possible.

# A Quick Documentation :page_with_curl:
